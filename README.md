# Caesar Cipher Class

## Overview

The **Caesar Cipher** class includes a method called `caesar_cipher_encrypt` that encrypts a given text using a shift value ranging from 1 to 25. The encryption follows the Caesar cipher rule, where each letter in the text is shifted by the specified number of places in the alphabet.

### Features:
- **Encryption**: The `caesar_cipher_encrypt` function encrypts the given text using the provided shift value.
- **Decryption**: To decrypt an encrypted text, the same function can be used by providing a negative shift value, effectively reversing the encryption.

## Issues with the Caesar Cipher Mechanism

1. **Limited Key Space**:
   - The Caesar cipher has a small key space (shift values ranging from 1 to 25). This makes it susceptible to brute-force attacks, as an attacker only needs a limited number of attempts to decrypt the text.

2. **Same Function for Encryption and Decryption**:
   - The use of the same function for both encryption and decryption increases its vulnerability to modern cryptanalysis and known-plaintext attacks.

### Notes:
While the Caesar cipher is a simple and effective introduction to encryption techniques, its inherent weaknesses make it unsuitable for secure communication in modern applications.
